  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: October 7, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Home Assistant Google Assistant integration
  operated under the domain <strong>codesware.com</strong> handles information.</p>

  <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
  <p>This integration is a private, self-hosted application owned and operated by the
  domain owner. It allows Google Assistant to interact with a locally hosted instance
  of Home Assistant for personal, household use.</p>

  <h2>2. Information Collected</h2>
  <p>The integration does not collect, store, or transmit personal data outside of the
  owner’s own Home Assistant installation. Any information (such as device states or
  automation events) remains local and private to the owner’s environment.</p>

  <h2>3. Use of Information</h2>
  <p>Information processed by this integration is used solely for enabling communication
  between Google Assistant and the owner’s Home Assistant installation. It is not used
  for analytics, advertising, or shared with third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>No personal data is stored by the codesware.com domain or its servers. All relevant
  data remains on the owner’s self-hosted Home Assistant instance.</p>

  <h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>No information is shared with or sold to any third parties. Data remains entirely
  within the owner’s household systems.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>The owner takes reasonable measures to protect the local Home Assistant installation.
  Since the integration is private and self-hosted, responsibility for system security
  lies with the owner of this domain and server.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This integration is not directed to children and is intended only for use by the
  domain owner and authorized household members.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>The owner may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Updates will be published at
  <a href="https://codesware.com/privacy.html">https://codesware.com/privacy.html</a>.</p>
